Attach and detach ebs on server start so we can use the launch script
Things to do before:
    1. look into minecraft server and see where its getting the world from. 
        and command to start server
Steps for Start:
1. RunInstance api call.  Give it a key pair? and AMI from dynamodb.  It returns array of instances
    Params:
        Shutdown Behavior: Terminate
        Instance size?: t3.small?
        AMI image id: grabbed from dynamo db
        Min and Max count: 1
        User Data: launch the minecraft server and do cron job for pinging discord bot
            Commands:
                cron job: (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 *   *   *   *   wget -q -O - "https://path.com/to/discord/bot" >/dev/null 2>&1") | crontab -
        Key name: minecraft server one, may need to find the id and hardcode or store it
        Everything else should come with the AMI
2. Enable Termination Protection on EC2 instance: maybe?
    Store Instance ID in dynamo
3. Start Instance api call, Using instance returned from RunInstance
*  Give ip address to Discord

Steps for stopping:
    Grab instance Id and from Dynamo, 
    use describe instances to get the volume id
1.  Create snapstop of the root volume
2.  Register a new AMI using the snapshot
3.  Store AMI and snapshotID in dynamoDb
4.  Stop EC2
    Delete old AMI and Snapshot
5.  release instance
