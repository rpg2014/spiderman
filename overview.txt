have a main that starts the http server
have dynamo wrapper that encrypts the names a map of the connections
    have it load the connects on load / then write the connections as it closes (maybe/ depends on if heroku gives up a signal when sleeping)
        (but then we would be stateful.  that might not work)
        store vertices that contain a list of edges 


have an s3 wrapper that grabs the joke / quote file (optional)
have http server listening for posts
    parses the post and determins if it is a command
        if command  run command that it is (reflection?)


write bash build script to grab new .jar file name and autogen the Proc file.
set up .env
